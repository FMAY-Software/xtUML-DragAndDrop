# Drag and drop support in Bridgepoint model explorer

This project enables drag and drop support for model elements in the Bridgepoint model explorer.  There are three types of drag and drop support added:

- Re-ordering of elements that have a reflexive ordering association.
- Moving an element from one parent into another (Cut/Paste).
- Copying an element from one parent into another (Copy/Paste).
